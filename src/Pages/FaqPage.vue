									<div class="paragraph-title">What den would my child be in?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>It's based on the grade level of the child. For example, a 1st-grader would be a Tiger and work toward earning that rank by the end of the school year. At the Rank Advancement Ceremony, they would earn their Tiger rank and sew it on their uniform. Here are the dens and what grade level they are:</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>Lion: Kindergarten</li>
												<li>Tiger: 1st grade</li>
												<li>Wolf: 2nd grade</li>
												<li>Bear: 3rd grade</li>
												<li>Webelos: 4th grade</li>
												<li>AOL (Arrow of Light): 5th grade</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
									</div>

									<div class="paragraph-title">How big are the dens?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>This varies from year to year, but we generally have a few different sizes of dens. The smaller dens can have as few as 2 Scouts, and the larger dens can have as many as 10 Scouts.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="paragraph-title">Do we have to go to a specific school?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>Packs are usually associated with a particular school. Ours is Walnut Springs. But you don't have to go to Walnut Springs to be in pack 280. In fact, a few of our Scouts already go to other schools.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="paragraph-title">What are the other packs in the area?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<!-- <p>If you are looking for an all-girl or mixed-gender pack, you might want to check out the following packs:</p> -->

									<!-- COST -->
									<div class="label currency-darken">COST</div>
									
									<div class="paragraph-title">What is cost to join Scouting?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>Our annual dues are $190. This covers council registration, pack expenses, and program costs. Some special trips and high-adventure camps may have additional fees. Families should also plan for the cost of a Scout uniform, which is purchased separately.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="paragraph-title">How much is the Scout Life magazine subscription?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>$15 per year and is optional.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="paragraph-title">Do I need to buy a Scout handbook?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>The Scout Handbook isn't technically required for a Cub Scout or Scout to participate in the program — you won't be turned away for not having one. However, it is highly recommended.</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>Reference for Scouts: The handbook lays out all the requirements, adventures, and skills scouts need to work on at each rank. It's designed to be their personal guide, and many scouts enjoy checking things off as they progress.</li>
												<li>Recordkeeping: It gives scouts a way to track their own progress and achievements, which helps build responsibility and pride in their accomplishments.</li>
												<li>Consistency: The handbook ensures everyone is on the same page, literally — it's the official source for requirements and helps reduce confusion.</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<p>That said, Den Leaders do use them regularly. Leaders often refer to the handbooks when planning activities, verifying requirements, and making sure the scouts are covering the right material. Even if a scout doesn't have their own copy, their leader will often reference it.</p>
										<p>So while it's not an absolute necessity to participate, having a handbook makes the experience smoother, clearer, and more rewarding for both scouts and families.</p>

									<!-- UNIFORMS -->
									<div class="label cub-scout-blue">UNIFORMS</div>

									<div class="paragraph-title">When do we wear uniforms?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>Class A for pack meetings and special events (like a Veteran's Day assembly at the school). We wear class B mostly for den meetings. Sometimes we wear both, like when we go on some campouts and have different kinds of activities.</p>
									</div>
									
									<div class="paragraph-title">How much are the uniforms?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>Please visit the <a href="https://www.capitolareascouting.org/shop/" target="_blank">Steve Matthews Scout Store</a> for the current prices. Uniforms are required, but many families donate gently used gear so younger Scouts can “age up” without extra expense. We often bring this box of goodies to pack meetings, especially near the beginning of each Scouting year.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="paragraph-title">Where do I get the uniforms?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>You can order them online from the <a href="https://www.capitolareascouting.org/shop/" target="_blank">Steve Matthews Scout Store</a> or visit them at 12500 N Interstate Hwy 35, Austin, TX 78753. Many parents have found that visiting in person is the best way to get the best fit and size.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="paragraph-title">How much are patches and belt loop awards?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>This cost is included in the annual dues.</p>
									</div>


									<!-- CAMPING -->
									<div class="label brown">CAMPING</div>
									<div class="paragraph-title">Can family members come on the campouts?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>We're a traditional (all-boys) pack, but Cub Scouting is a family adventure! Parents camp with their Scouts, and siblings and moms are always welcome at events like campouts, Pinewood Derby, and banquets.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="paragraph-title">Do I need to supply my own gear?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>For campouts, each Scout and their family should bring their own personal gear — such as a tent, sleeping pad, sleeping bag, mess kit, extra clothes, and the Scout "Six Essentials." These are the items that help keep each Scout comfortable and prepared. The pack takes care of the group needs like cooking equipment, campfire supplies, and shared materials, so families don't need to worry about bringing those.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="paragraph-title">What are the Scout "Six Essentials"?</div>
									<div class="paragraph-description">
										<p>The Scout "Six Essentials" are a list of items that every Scout should have on them at all times. They are:</p>
										<p>
											<ul>
												<li>A first aid kit</li>
												<li>Water bottle</li>
												<li>Flashlight</li>
												<li>Trail food</li>
												<li>Sun protection</li>
												<li>Whistle</li>
